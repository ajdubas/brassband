    Analyses the table in <filename>.

    Estimates probability of promotion, retention or relegation
    depending on finishing position.
    Assumes all bands in the section have an equal chance
    of finishing in all positions.
    Output is written to console.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename: string
        Name of the file containing the section data.
    nPromoted: integer
        Number of bands promoted in the section.
    nRelegated: integer
        Number of bands relegated in the section.
    nSamplesPerBand: integer (default 1000)
        Number of times to sample finishing position.
        The larger this is, the greater the accuracy,
        but the longer the calculation time.
    absentBands: list of strings
        List of absent bands.
