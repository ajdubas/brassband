Simulation code for brass band regional contests results calculations.

The weird and wonderful way brass band regional contest results are calculated
means there is no obvious answer to the question:
*where do we need to come to get promoted / avoid relegation.*
This software attempts to answer that question
given a grading table and number to promote / relegate
and using stochastic simulation to obtain the probabilities of
promotion / non-movement / relegation for each finishing place.
